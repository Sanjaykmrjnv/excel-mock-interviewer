# AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer — PoC

A compact, demo-ready Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that simulates a short Excel technical interview, evaluates answers (deterministic checks for uploaded workbooks + optional LLM-based commentary), manages interview state, and produces a constructive feedback summary.

This repo is optimized to get you a working, shareable demo in ~2 days using a single Streamlit app (fastest path). It’s intentionally small, easy to extend, and ready to deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud.
